## Credit Risk and Loan Analysis Dashboard ðŸ“Š  
This project analyzes credit risk and loan approval trends using an interactive Power BI dashboard. It covers data loading, cleaning, analysis, and visualization, with all steps documented in Jupyter notebooks.  

### **Project Overview**  
The goal is to provide insights into loan approval rates, credit risks, and loan characteristics. This helps financial analysts and decision-makers understand key factors affecting loan approvals and potential risks.  

**Note:** This project is still in progress.

### **Data Processing (Using Python)**  
- **Data Loading & Cleaning:** ðŸ“¥ Uses Pandas to load raw data, handle missing values, convert data types, and remove duplicates. Saves cleaned data for further analysis.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** ðŸ“Š Uses Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations, and Pandas for statistical analysis to examine data distribution, relationships, and potential issues.  
- **Loan Data Analysis & Visualizations:** ðŸ“ˆ Feature engineering, Pandas for data processing, and Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualizations. Saves the processed data for Power BI.

#### **Key Visuals in the Dashboard:**  
- Loan approval rates by income category  
- Approved vs. denied loan percentages  
- Credit risk and applicant profile analysis (age, credit history, default rates)  
- Loan details and intent analysis (loan amount, interest rate, loan purpose)
